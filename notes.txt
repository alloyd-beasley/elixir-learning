Generating a Project
    - use mix from CLI
    - mix new <project name> will generate a new project. 

Elixir Modules
    - defmodule <Module name>
    - generated when using mix
    - a module is a collection of methods or functions
    - to run a module, run iex.bat (powershell) -S mix
        - interactive elixir shell
        - can run elixir code here

Functional v OOP
    - Module, standalone object
        - has no idea what an instance variable is. 
        - collection of methods and nothing more.
        - methods operate on their arguments, not instance variables

Method arguments
    - can have multiple methods with the same name
    - elixir will differentiate like this: 
        shuffle/0, shuffle method with no arguments
        shuffle/1, shuffle method with 1 argument
    - arity: the number of arguments a method accepts. 

Enums
    - elixir standard library for operations on enumerables
    - any type of enumerable collection of data

Immutability in Elixir
    - elixir does not modify existing data structure in place. 
    - any standard method returns a new data structure.

Methods?
    - question marks in variable names are valid in elixir. 
    - used to denote that the method is asking a question and probably returns a boolean
    - contains? ... probably returns a boolean on whether or not something contains something else. 
    - can pattern match arguments directly.
    - pass reference to a function &function/1
    
Pattern Matching
     - elixirs replacement for variable assignment
     - 

Saving to the file system
    - have to use erlang to encode your info to binary
    - write to file system using File

Maps
    - collections of key/value pairs
    - colors = %{primary: "red"}
    - colors.primary = "red"
    - %{secondary} = colors (pattern matching)

    updating
        - use map standard library functions, map.put(map, key , val)
        - does not update existing map, returns a new map\

        - %{colors | primary: "blue"}, create a new map from colors, pipe value for primary
        - cannot be used to add a new property to the map

Keyword Lists
    - colors = [{:primary, "red"}, {:secondary, "green"}]
        - [primary: "red", secondary: "green"]
        - colors[:primary] = "red"
        - 
    - colors = [primary: "red", secondary: "blue"]
    - when passing a keyword list as the last argument to a function, [] can be omitted. 
        - function(primary: "red", secondary: "green")    

Structs
    - a map that is used to store data in an application. 
    - two advantages over maps: can assign default values, compile time type checking. 
    - define structs in their own module attached to the application. 
    - if you know the properties that you are going to be working with, use struct over map.
